## Usage
Add solutions to LeetCode challenges, inside a directory named after the challenge, to the solutions directory. The directory name must match the name of a LeetCode challenge. If the challenge directory does not contain a README, GitHub Actions will generate one from the challenge description on LeetCode.com and add it to the table on the main repo README.

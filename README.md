# LeetCode Solutions
As solutions to LeetCode challenges are added to the solutions folder, Github Actions automatically generate documentation from the challenge description on [LeetCode.com](http://leetcode.com)

## Solutions
| LC # | Challenge Overview | Difficulty | Solutions | Category |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| [1603](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/) | [Running Sum of 1d Array](solutions/running-sum-of-1d-array) | Easy | [C++](solutions/running-sum-of-1d-array/solution.cpp),  | Algorithms |

## Usage
Add solutions to LeetCode challenges, inside a directory named after the challenge, to the solutions directory. The directory name must match the name of a LeetCode challenge. If the challenge directory does not contain a README, GitHub Actions will generate one from the challenge description on LeetCode.com and add it to the table on the main repo README.

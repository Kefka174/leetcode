# Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings <code>text1</code> and <code>text2</code>, return *the length of their longest **common subsequence**. *If there is no **common subsequence**, return <code>0</code>.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, <code>"ace"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"abcde"</code>.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.


**Example 1:**
>
> **Input:** text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
>
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**
>
> **Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
>
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**
>
> **Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
>
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= text1.length, text2.length &lt;= 1000</code>

- <code>text1</code> and <code>text2</code> consist of only lowercase English characters.

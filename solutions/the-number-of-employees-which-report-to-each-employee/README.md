> This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null).


For this problem, we will consider a **manager** an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all **managers**, the number of employees who report **directly** to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by <code>employee_id</code>.

The&nbsp;result format is in the following example.


**Example 1:**
>
> **Input:**
>
> Employees table:
>
> +-------------+---------+------------+-----+
>
> | employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
>
> +-------------+---------+------------+-----+
>
> | 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
>
> | 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
>
> | 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
>
> | 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |
>
> +-------------+---------+------------+-----+
>
> **Output:**
>
> +-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
>
> | employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
>
> +-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
>
> | 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |
>
> +-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
>
> **Explanation:** Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.

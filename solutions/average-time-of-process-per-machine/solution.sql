-- The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
-- (machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
-- machine_id is the ID of a machine.
-- process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
-- activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
-- timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
-- 'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
-- The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.

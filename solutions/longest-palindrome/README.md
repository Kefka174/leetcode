# Longest Palindrome

Given a string <code>s</code> which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return *the length of the **longest palindrome***&nbsp;that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example,&nbsp;<code>"Aa"</code> is not considered a palindrome here.


**Example 1:**
>
> **Input:** s = "abccccdd"
>
> **Output:** 7
>
> **Explanation:** One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

**Example 2:**
>
> **Input:** s = "a"
>
> **Output:** 1
>
> **Explanation:** The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 2000</code>

- <code>s</code> consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English&nbsp;letters only.
